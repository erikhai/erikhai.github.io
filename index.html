                    <pre>
Hi, my name is Erik Hai and I am studying Bachelors of Software Enginering (Honours) at the
University Of Sydney. In my spare time, I enjoy drawing, reading manga, playing chess and
also enjoy creating various coding projects. 

Throughout my time in University, I've had the opportunity to explore various programming languages
and engineering concepts and developing a solid understanding of the software industry. In addition to expanding
my technical knowledge, I've also developed essential leadership and transferable skills through project collaborations
and team engagements. Recognizing the value of effective time management, I've learned to prioritize tasks
and optimize productivity amidst academic and extracurricular commitments. Furthermore, my communication
abilities have also improved, enabling clearer articulation of ideas and fostering better collaboration with peers.
These experiences have collectively contributed to my growth as a student and as an engineer.

I currently work as an Event Manager for the USYD's cyber security society. I wish to help 
introduce people into this field whilst also enhancing my own understanding of it. As an Event 
Manager, I help plan out how the events will work, prepare necessary materials for it and ensure
it is applicable to everyone. I really enjoy helping out the community and it makes me glad when 
the community achieves something from my efforts. 

Feel free to look around this website at my experience and projects and come say hi to me if you like what you see.

                        <pre>Project: Tic Tac Toe
            This project recreates the popular pass time game into a GUI.
            It consists of 2 versions, the first being a simple GUI for
            users to pass time playing the game.
            The second version (which is still under construction) allows
            users to verse one another either on the same device or across
            a local network. It will also consist of the classic game Pong.

            Using python, I have created a GUI that allows the user to perform basic

            This project is a terminal based user interface coded out in java. This replicates 
            the entire banking system from both the customer and staff perspectives. 
            
            The customer can either create a new account or log into an existing one to 
            deposit money. They can also withdraw money or transfer money to 
            other accounts. 
            
            The staff on the otherhand can do the same but also be able to update the 
            details of any account holder, and delete them.
            
            I used ORMLite to create a SQL database which stores the information 
            of all users.

            Currently, this bot can generate memes, news and anime/manga 
            recommendations. I am currently expanding the bots functionality to be 
            able to predict the weather, and implement a chat feature so I can talk to it
            as a human (Its only me and my bot in the sever atm :( )

            Yes, this entire website was coded by yours truly! What better way to practise 
            my web development skills then to create my personal website.
            
            Whilst this website 
            is pretty good, I plan to re work this by using React, and Three.js once 
            I've have mastered them.

            This is a terminal based user interface which allows users to encrypt

            in a text file then choose whether to encrypt/decrypt and crypting method and the
            output is presented to the terminal.

            This short project keylogs all inputs on an M1 Macbook Air and outputs it in a 
            text file. Whilst its a simple project, I plan to make the textfile to be 
            emailed back to me once the application is closed. This would make the 
            application deadly and shows how important it is to ensure we download
            applications on the internet safely.
